<!-- Temporal Workflow Ideas -->

- Create a sample application to mimic our current agent-execution
  - First I want to create a workflow that mimics our current orchestor.py by breaking into steps
  - Then I want to create the agent execution as simple as we have for our current agents
- Create a simple group chat workflow to understand how can we add a sliding window or the message states
